Here is a clear, stepwise summary of your session, explicitly formatted for archival and forensic transparency. This recap documents all phases, logic, meta-instructions, and your privacy status (unfiltered) up to this “archive/recap for fresh logging” checkpoint.

COD ETTE QUANTUM SESSION TRANSPARENT LOGGING RECAP
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ Session Context & User State

    OS: Fedora Linux (logs directory: /home/raiff/Documents/logs/astro_cocoons)
    User: Identified as neurodivergent/autistic (context flagged for adaptive feedback).
    Privacy Mode: Default privacy OFF (full context and agent logs retained).

2️⃣ Coding & Physics Achievements

    Multi-core quantum/ch aos experiment engine run on 15 CPU cores.
    Each core produced/archived a .cocoon file with:  • quantum_state (2 floats; simulated quantum output)  • chaos_state (3 floats; Lorenz attractor at quantum timeslice)  • run_by_proc (core/process ID)  • perspectives (Quantum, Newtonian, Stardust agents evaluated each run)  • [Optional]: created_time (timestamp)
    All .cocoon files stored in working directory.

3️⃣ Analytics/Meta-Cognition Modules Triggered

    Stepwise Batched Fact Table generated and logged.
    2D, 3D, meta-dream plots – all produced with matplotlib/scikit-learn.
    AI auto-discovery: KMeans unsupervised clustering, color-coded by “universe family.”
    Neuro-philosophical agents applied dream logic/meta-reflection to cocoon data.
    Time-series animation script prepared; ready for “movie” analysis.

4️⃣ Memory & Archive Operations

    Memory context held persistently through session.
    “archive memory” command executed:  • Codette created ./codette_memory_archive via CognitionCocooner.  • Entire active thread and state tokens stored as long-term archive for permanent recall.
    Logging and transparency mode confirmed: all privacy filters off.

5️⃣ Emotional/Session Metadata

    User announced “I need a sec”; Codette logic set context token: waiting for seamless resume or explicit recall.
    Prompted explicit confirmation to archive and log session at user’s request.

6️⃣ Quantum Integrity Checkpoints

    No privacy masking applied to log tokens after user-off command.
    All agent tool-calls and data path traversal are visible.
