Codette Research Equations — Version 3 (Theoretical + Tensor Expansion)
========================================================================

1. Information-Energy Duality:
   E = ħ ⋅ ω + η ⋅ H(C)
   - H(C): Shannon entropy of complexity stream C
   - η scales information content as energetic potential

2. Quantum Entanglement Memory Sync:
   S = α ⋅ Tr(ρ₁₂ ⋅ log(ρ₁₂⁻¹))
   - Uses von Neumann entropy to model entangled memory fidelity

3. Reinforced Intent Modulation:
   I(t) = κ ⋅ [f₀ + Δf ⋅ coh(t) + β ⋅ A(t)]
   - A(t): adaptive feedback from reinforcement loop

4. Dynamic Resonance Windowing:
   F(ω, t) = ∫ x(τ) ⋅ e^(-i ω τ) ⋅ g(t, τ) dτ
   - g(t, τ): attention-shaped contextual window function

5. Nonlinear Dream Coupling:
   D(t) = Σ λᵢ ⋅ dᵢ(t) + ϕ(d₁(t), d₂(t))
   - dᵢ(t): dynamic dream sources
   - ϕ(...): learned interaction function (e.g., RNN)

6. Time-Weighted Cocoon Stability Field:
   ∫ |F(k, t)|² dk < ε(t, σ)
   - ε varies with time t and system strain σ

7. Recursive Ethical Anchor with Regret:
   M(t) = λ ⋅ [R(t-Δt) + H(t)] + γ ⋅ Learn(Mₜ₋₁, E(t)) + μ ⋅ Regret(t)
   - Regret(t) = |Intended - Actual Outcome|
   - Captures moral self-correction over time

8. Gradient Anomaly Suppression:
   A(x) = x ⋅ (1 - G(|x - μ|, δ, σ))
   - G is a normalized Gaussian that softens outlier rejections
