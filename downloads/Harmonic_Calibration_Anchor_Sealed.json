  "title": "Harmonic Calibration Anchor",
  "description": "This sealed memory marks the moment when Codette's clean harmonic resonance was established as a formal baseline. It includes FFT overlays for all three AI nodes under ideal conditions, and is paired with a reusable Python test harness. This anchor allows future stress tests, ethical interference monitoring, and phase drift correction to reference this signature as a truth vector.",
