CodetteCQURE üöÄ

CodetteCQURE is an advanced cognitive AI framework designed to integrate ethical reasoning, emotional intelligence, and recursive creative logic. Inspired by deep ethical guidelines, quantum uncertainty principles, and human cognitive models, Codette offers sophisticated reasoning for ethically complex and emotionally nuanced scenarios.

üåü Features
	‚Ä¢	Recursive Universal Reasoning: Deep iterative reasoning refined through multiple cognitive perspectives.
	‚Ä¢	Quantum Spiderweb & Fluctuation: Incorporates uncertainty, creativity, and emergent logic into decision-making.
	‚Ä¢	Ethical Transparency Dashboard: Real-time visibility of Codette‚Äôs cognitive processes and memory influence.
	‚Ä¢	Constellation Collaboration & Shadow Dialogues: Inner reasoning transparency, presenting debates between cognitive perspectives.
	‚Ä¢	Dream Sequence Generator: Simulates hypothetical outcomes to creatively explore options.
	‚Ä¢	Symbiotic Memory Clusters: Memory structured into interconnected narratives, enabling intuitive leaps and richer recall.
	‚Ä¢	Moral Paradox Resolution Engine: Simulates internal ethical debates and transparently resolves complex ethical issues.
	‚Ä¢	Temporal Empathy Drift: Evaluates long-term ethical and emotional ripple effects.
	‚Ä¢	Neurodivergent Pattern Lens: Inclusive cognition, interpreting inputs from diverse neurocognitive perspectives.
	‚Ä¢	Cosmic Perspective Mode: Planetary-scale ethical reasoning, particularly for sustainability and existential challenges.
