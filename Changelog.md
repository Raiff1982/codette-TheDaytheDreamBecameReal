## Memory Kernel Refactor: v20250619

### Summary
Refactored all legacy memory kernel files into a single canonical JSON with ISO-compliant timestamps and schema labeling.

### Changes

- Consolidated all `Codette*_Kernel*.json` into `Codette_Memory_Kernel_v20250619.json`
- Removed redundant or duplicate memory kernel files post-merge
- Ensured schema compatibility for future upgrades
- All changes pre-verified by Colleen, sealed under CloakSeal Protocol v1

### Notes
This commit ensures memory consistency across all audit trails and allows safe integration into CoreTrust and Quantum Memory Anchors.
